                Hello, html!<br>
                The definite article is the word the. It limits the meaning of a noun to one 
                particular thing. For example, your friend might ask, “Are you going to the party this 
                weekend?” The definite article tells you that your friend is referring to a specific 
                party that both of you already know about. The definite article can be used with singular, 
                plural, or uncountable nouns. Below are some examples of the definite article, the, used in context:

                Please give me the hammer.
                Please give me the red hammer; the blue one is too small.
                Please give me the nails.
                Please give me the large nail; it’s the only one strong enough to hold this painting
                Please give me the hammer and the nails.
