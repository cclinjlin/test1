                    How do you know which wedges are best for you? 
                Well there are a few key things you need to think 
                about. For example, what bounce angle will suit your
                action, and which grinds and lofts you'll need. 
                Lofts are especially importing for gapping in your 
                bag and it will determine how many wedges you want 
                to carry.
                You should also have a think about what you like aesthetically 
                as most wedges come in a variety of finishes, such as 
                satin, chrome, black or a raw finish that will rust over 
                time. There are performance benefits to the raw finish but 
                not everyone will like a rusted faced club in their bag. So 
                take a look at our selection of the best golf wedges on the 
                market to help you hone your short-game skills and lower 
                your scores.
                Goals from Alexis Mac Allister and Jarell Quansah in the first 
                half on Sunday ensured Klopp's 491st and final game in 
                charge ended in a 2-0 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers 
                – the 305th win of his unforgettable and triumphant reign.

                After delivering a farewell speech to his adoring Anfield public, 
                the boss then spoke to the media for the last time.
                See everything Klopp said below.
                No, I don't think it's normal. I knew for a long time 
                already that our relationship was pretty special, I love 
                that. I really think that the people made a difference for 
                this club. How I said, these people are the superpower of this club, these people keep the club going, these people push the club, these people carry the club through difficult moments. These people are the club. So, obviously we had a really good time together, nine years, nearly a decade. It was absolutely crazy. Kids who today were in the stadium, kids of the staff who were today in the stadium and I saw after the game, they don't know another manager of Liverpool FC. That's how it is – they just think I was always there and will always be there and now I'm gone.

                I expected… I was a bit afraid of a breakdown. I had one or 
                two moments during the week where it was not great and 
                during the game the last few minutes were tricky, but the 
                general feeling today was it felt more like a start than an 
                end because I know the goodbye is about me but in general 
                it is about the team and I saw a wonderful team and I saw a
                 wonderful team on the way. I saw a team who is ahead of 
                 schedule in their development. It's a tough league and you 
                 never know where you start again but I saw just a good 
                 football team, and I saw all the young players who saved 
                 our backside a couple of times this year and none of them 
                 besides Conor [Bradley] and Jarell – Jarell played and 
                 Conor was on the bench and the others were all not 
                 involved today. They are there as well and that's what 
                 gave me the feeling of, 'OK, job done.'

                I love you all, I love all and everything about the 
                club but it's time for me to go. But look, it's not burning 
                behind me and that gives me a good feeling. It's not that 
                you think, 'Come on, get out of here!' So, I know I can come
                 back and I will come back and how I said after the game, 
                 from today, from three hours ago when the game finished, 
                 I'm a Liverpool supporter and I love that.

                Ａ picture, short film, song, etc. that tries to 
                persuade people to buy a product or service
                a paid notice that tells people about a product or service
                The first thing to say is that SM9 has retained the classic 
                Vokey look at address from the impressive SM8 wedge. 
                When hitting full shots, the shaping and lack of offset 
                inspire confidence, while around the green they look 
                inviting behind the ball. You could argue the lower lofted 
                wedges in SM9 have a slightly straighter leading edge, 
                which helps with alignment on full shots and the transition 
                from your irons.
                Having used a 52° and 58° SM6 for the last couple of seasons, 
                I definitely haven’t been getting the most out of my short 
                game, so it’ll be no surprise to learn that I saw great 
                all-round gains magnified by the fitting process. 

                There are the same six grind options 
                in SM9 - F, S, K, L, M and D - and a total of 23 
                different models ranging in lofts from 46° to 62°. 
                However, like many, I’ve always assumed that a middle 
                ground in terms of bounce is preferable as it provides 
                versatility. Hitting shots to a flag 50 yards away in 
                soft-ish conditions highlighted the mistake I've been making 
                for years.
